This is a pre code for Easy Vision. 
It currently can be used for RealSense camera image capture and also Handeyes calibration by using charuco code.
Both those two functions have user friendly interface.
Later it will integrate more cameras like Esenso, zivid, Hikvision, Orbecc,etc and also support more powerful alogrithm.
Free to use, if you are intersting in this.
